# canonyousuf-cli-number-guessing

Welcome to my first TypeScript project! This is a command-line interface (CLI) based number guessing game. The game generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct..

## ðŸŽ® Game Overview

The number guessing game is a simple yet fun project designed to help me get comfortable with TypeScript and CLI programming. The objective is to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Inquirer.js**: Library for creating interactive CLI prompts.

## ðŸš€ How to Play the Game

To play the game, open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

```sh
npx canonyousuf-cli-number-guessing
