# Embodied Intelligence

**Physical AI** is not just about LLMs; it is about intelligence that **acts upon the physical world**.

In this course, we will bridge the gap between:
- **Digital Intelligence**: Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision (CV), and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
- **Physical Embodiment**: Dynamics, Kinematics, Actuators, and Sensors.

## The Humanoid Form Factor

Humanoid robots present unique challenges in balance, locomotion, and manipulation. Unlike wheeled robots, they must actively maintain stability.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Perception**: Understanding the environment through Lidar, Cameras, and IMUs.
2.  **Planning**: Deciding *where* to go and *how* to move (Nav2, MoveIt).
3.  **Control**: Executing the plan with motor torques (ROS 2 Control).
4.  **Learning**: Adapting to new tasks via VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models.
