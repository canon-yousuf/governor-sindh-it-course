# TypeScript Practice: 5-Day Coding Challenge

This repository contains the code and exercises for a 5-day TypeScript coding challenge. Each day focuses on a different aspect of TypeScript, building up to a final project: a Task Management Application.

## Challenge Overview

- **Day 1**: Arrays
- **Day 2**: Loops
- **Day 3**: Functions
- **Day 4**: Enums
- **Day 5**: Task Management Application

## Day 1: Arrays

On the first day, we practice using arrays in TypeScript. This includes creating arrays, accessing elements, and using various array methods.

### Exercises

- Create an array of tasks.
- Add new tasks to the array.
- Remove tasks from the array.
- Filter tasks based on a condition.

## Day 2: Loops

The second day focuses on loops. We practice using `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and `forEach` loops to iterate over arrays and perform operations.

### Exercises

- Iterate over the array of tasks.
- Print each task to the console.
- Find a specific task using a loop.

## Day 3: Functions

On the third day, we practice writing functions in TypeScript. This includes creating functions with parameters and return types, as well as higher-order functions.

### Exercises

- Write functions to add, remove, and find tasks in the array.
- Refactor array operations from Day 1 into functions.

## Day 4: Enums

The fourth day is dedicated to enums. We learn how to define and use enums to represent specific sets of values.

### Exercises

- Define an enum for task status.
- Create an interface for a task using the enum.

## Day 5: Task Management Application

On the final day, we integrate everything we've learned to build a Task Management Application. This project includes adding tasks, listing tasks, and updating task statuses.
